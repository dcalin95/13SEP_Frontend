      Status and Acceptance of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the “Policy”) sets forth the general rules of Users and Participants’ personal data collection, processing, distribution, use, and retention by the Company during the $BITS Token Sale event or ICO. It also includes general rules and procedures in accordance with relevant Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) regulations, should the Company be subject to them. If you (User or Participant) do not agree with the provisions of this Privacy Policy, you must refrain from using the Website or participating in the $BITS Token Sale event.

Throughout this Policy, BitswapDEX LAB (“Company,” “We,” or “Us”) uses the term Personal Data to describe information that can be associated with a specific person (the Participant) and can be used to identify that person. This includes information about the Participant’s activities, such as website usage, time spent on the Website, and actions taken while visiting the Website. This applies when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable data, including data automatically collected. The Company does not consider Personal Data to include anonymized information that cannot identify a specific Participant.

The legal entity acting as the personal data processing entity is BitswapDEX LAB, incorporated under the laws of Seychelles with company number 240961, and registered address: Suite 1, Second Floor, Sound & Vision House, Rue Pierre De Possession, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.

This Policy is an inalienable part of the General Terms & Conditions of $BITS Token Sale (“Terms”). For aspects not regulated by this Policy, the General Terms & Conditions of $BITS Token Sale apply to the relationships that arise hereunder.

The definitions set forth in this Policy and mentioned with capital letters shall have the meaning described in the General Terms & Conditions of $BITS Token Sale.

Each Participant must carefully read and comply with this Policy. It is understood that by using the Website, checking the relevant boxes during the registration process, purchasing $BITS Tokens during the Token Sale, or providing us with Personal Data at our request, the Participant confirms that they have fully read, understood, and accepted this Policy. If any Participant does not agree with this Policy or any part of it, such a Participant must not access or use the Website or purchase $BITS Tokens.

Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data

The purpose of collecting, storing, and processing personal data is to identify you as a Participant in the Token Sale and for other purposes as described below.

BitswapDEX LAB collects Personal Data through the operation of its Website and by using the information provided by Participants. When Users or Participants visit or use our services, the Company collects the Personal Data sent by their computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This Personal Data includes, but is not limited to:
    Your IP address
    Device information, including but not limited to the device identifier, name, type, operating system, and mobile network information.
    Standard web log data, such as browser type and pages accessed on the Website.

When Participants use location-enabled devices with the Company’s Website or products, we may collect geographic location data or use various means to determine location, such as sensor data from the Participant’s device. However, personally identifying information of this kind will not be released to any third party without your explicit consent, except as specified in this Policy.

If Users wish to purchase $BITS Tokens (to become Participants), the Company collects and stores the following types of Personal Data:
    Your wallet address.

In certain circumstances (e.g., when additional verification by compliance authorities or state bodies is required under governmental regulations, or under the Company’s AML or KYC policies), the Company may request additional information, such as:
    First and last name.
    Email address.
    Passport information (number, serial information, issue date, expiry date, photo, and other relevant details, depending on the issuing country).
    Date of birth.
    Other information upon request.

The above information (clause 9) must be provided upon specific request to the Participant and will be communicated through email or via the Website.

The Company does not process sensitive Personal Data (as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], such as religion, race, ethnicity, or political views). If requested documents are submitted, the Company may require them to be certified as a true copy of the original by a Solicitor or Lawyer, including their company or personal stamp, if applicable. Documents must be sent in high-quality color format. The Company reserves the right to reject documents that fail to meet these standards or if there are doubts about their authenticity.

This revised section preserves the structure and meaning of the original while ensuring improved clarity, readability, and alignment with the updated details. Let me know if you’d like me to refine or expand further!
