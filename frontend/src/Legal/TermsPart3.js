        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>Appendix B: Risks

The Participant understands that $BITS Tokens, underlying blockchain technologies, and related systems are new, untested, and outside of the Company’s exclusive control. Adverse changes in market forces or technology may impact or compromise the Company’s ability to meet its obligations under these Terms.

Participants agree that no party may be held liable for losses arising from participation in the $BITS Token Sale, or from receiving and holding $BITS Tokens, including risks detailed below.

In addition, before acquiring $BITS Tokens, Participants acknowledge they have been informed of the following risks:
A. Legal Risks Regarding Securities Regulations

There is a small risk that in some jurisdictions, $BITS Tokens may be considered securities now or in the future. The Company does not guarantee that $BITS Tokens are not securities in all jurisdictions. Each Participant is responsible for ensuring that acquiring and using $BITS Tokens complies with the laws of their jurisdiction.

If it is determined that the use or possession of $BITS Tokens is not legal in a jurisdiction, Participants must cease use and possession immediately. Regulatory scrutiny of cryptographic tokens may continue to evolve, potentially limiting the Company’s ability to offer $BITS Tokens or operate the platform in certain regions.

In such cases, the Company may:

    Cease operations in that jurisdiction, or
    Adjust the Tokens and Platform to comply with regulations, if feasible.

B. Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Actions

Blockchain technologies face scrutiny from regulatory bodies worldwide. Restrictions on the use or possession of $BITS Tokens could affect their functionality, value, or permissibility. Legislation concerning DAOs, VASP providers, and other blockchain-related entities may also create additional risks.
C. Risk of Theft and Hacking

Hackers or other malicious actors may target wallets, the Website, or $BITS Tokens through various attacks (e.g., denial of service, Sybil attacks, malware). The Company is not liable for any losses incurred due to such attacks.
D. Risk of Security Weaknesses

The Website, $BITS Tokens, and related infrastructure may unintentionally include bugs or weaknesses in their code, potentially resulting in loss or misuse of Tokens.
E. Risk of Breakthroughs in Cryptography

Advances in cryptography, including quantum computing, could compromise the security of blockchain systems, leading to theft or loss of $BITS Tokens.
F. Risk of Uninsured Losses

$BITS Tokens are not insured like traditional bank accounts or financial products.
G. Risk of Blockchain Malfunction

Networks interacting with $BITS Tokens could malfunction, potentially causing loss of Tokens or disruptions in the platform’s operation.
H. Internet Transmission Risks

Using $BITS Tokens involves risks associated with hardware, software, and internet failures. The Company is not responsible for communication failures, errors, or delays caused by such issues.
I. Unanticipated Risks

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are new and untested. There are unanticipated risks that cannot be foreseen, which may arise during or after the Token Sale.
J. Insufficient Interest in BitSwapDEX AI, the Platform, and $BITS Tokens

Lack of widespread interest in the Company, Tokens, or Platform may hinder development and lead to price volatility for $BITS Tokens.
K. Tokens and the Platform May Not Meet Expectations

The Platform is under development and may change significantly before release. Participants’ expectations regarding the functionality of the Tokens and Platform may not be met due to changes in design, business model, or implementation plans.
